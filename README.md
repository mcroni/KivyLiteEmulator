<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Kivy is an awesome framework for creating GUI apps. However it lacks one of the most sought after features of a GUI framework which is an 
autoreloader. We are currently working on a kivystudio. Before releasing a stable version,  i just need something to help me display my UI in realtime.

This currently works with some of the apps i have created, it seems it is scared of bigger projects,:smile: lol,

You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
